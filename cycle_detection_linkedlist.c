/*
	FLOYD'S TORTOISE AND HARE CYCLE DETECTION ALGORITHM

	1. LOOP DETECTION

    -	Traverse linked list using two pointers.
    -	Move one pointer(slow pointer) by one and another pointer(fast pointer) by two.
    -	If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not
    	meet then linked list doesn't have a loop.

    2. FINDING THE FIRST NODE WHERE THE CYCLE BEGINS


    -	If a loop is found, initialize a slow pointer to head, let fast pointer be at its position.
    -	Move both slow and fast pointers one node at a time.
    -	The point at which they meet is the start of the loop
